# Roundnet_Germany

In this repository we show, why you should sponsor the new trendsport Roundnet. The sport itself was created in 1989, but wasn't secussfull in that time. It was recovered by Chris Ruder in 2008 (creating of the brand Spikeball Inc - the most famous net producer) and became popular in very short time in North America. 2016 it also came to Europe and to the rest of the world and is still becoming more and more popular.

But what is so special about Roundnet? The first thing is, that the playerzone in a 360 Degress field. So it's very dynamic. The rules are closely to beach-volleyball and it's easy to play on a fun level for everybody. The second thing is, that you can play it on every surface. You just need a net and a place with some space and you can start playing!

Okey, we said that Roundnet is a rising sport. But is it? To prove that, we got the data of the playerzone of the German Roundnet association "Roundnet-Germany". If you want to enrole to a tournament, you have to register there, so we got information about all official tournaments played in germany since 2016, the numbers of players, their origin and additionaly since 2022 their rank. 

To prove our suggestions we first had to combine all the given tables out ouf a SQLDump. For that we uses Python on VSCode and altered that tables with SQL on DBeaver. How we did this you can find in the mergin.ipynb and the Roundnet_alter_table_file.sql. Our calculations you can find than on the Roundnet_EDV.sql. The visiualisations and the dashboard we created lately with Tableau.

With the help of our data we could prove, that the sport itself is growing! Every variable we looked for over time was growing, especially from 2021 to 2022. 
For us that wasn't a big surprice as Roundet Germany does much efforts to achieve the goal to be somedays an Olympic Sports.

Additionaly, to provide you with the information you need, to decide, which club you want to sponsor, we created a dashboard! You can find it here as a wbtx file (dashboard_sponsoring.wbtx). Just set the location your company is in and a radius. Than the table will show you necessary information about the clubs in the giving radius to lead you to the right decision.
